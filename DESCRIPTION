Package: BayesianFirstAid
Title: Bayesian replacements for the most commonly used statistical tests in R.
Description: The idea with this R package is to make "replacements" for the
    most commonly used tests in R such as `t.test`, `binom.test` and
    `cor.test`. These replacements will be based on Bayesian estimation and
    will in that sense neither be "null hypothesis" nor "tests". They will be
    replacements in that they will have similar assumptions as the original
    tests and will answer the the same type of question as one probably have
    when using the corresponding null hypothesis test. This package requires a
    working instalation of [JAGS](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/). The
    package uses code, both modified and copied directly, from the BEST package
    (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BEST/index.html) and from the stats
    package part of base R.
